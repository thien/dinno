# Project scope

## Purpose of Software Project

The purpose of this project is to provide a internet based solution that allows users to give away unwanted food items to others. We aim to achieve this by making the human interaction part of the system as simple as possible without imposing restrictions on how complex the features could be. Because it is an internet based solution, it can provide affordances that only this type of medium can provide, such as the ability to scale the layout of the program to different devices efficently. Due to the ubiquity of internet browsers, it makes it viable to reach a wide audience.

## Benefits

There are many benefits that this software project will provide, which are not limited to:

- The project will allow users to give away unwanted food items.
- The project will allow users to advertise unwanted food items.
- The project will help spread goodwill among users.
- The project will provides a good experience in what software engineering in a group entails.
- The project will provide experience in a new programming paradigm.
- reduce household spending bills

## Project Boundaries

For the moment we will not be producing a native mobile application from scratch, as our group collectively have little to zero experience in this particular environment, adding to the timespan needed to produced such a program. Additionally, the performance that this app will provide as opposed to a web-container style app isn't enough to justify the program to be made.


## Product Vision

- user has food he is willing to give away
- user goes to our website
- user scans or puts in details of the food, alongside an assisting photo

- another user goes to site
- another user searches for an item they like
- user adds to basket
- both agree to meet up and food items.
- both users rate each other's experience.

## User Base

- users wishing to give away food
- users wishing to find free food
- users with a full pantry
- users short on free good
- anyone >=18 years old with knowledge of the internet
