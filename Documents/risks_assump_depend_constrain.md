# Risks, Assumptions, Constraints & Dependencies

## Project Risks

**Communication:**

- Breakdown in communication/arguments with team members – someone should always be keeping track of how people are getting on with each other and their own work.

- Not enough regular communication with client – should be check-ups each week showing client what has been done.

- Time wasted due to waiting for client approval on certain features – make sure while waiting team members should be occupied with something else (allow for dynamic scheduling)

**Time Management/Scheduling:**

- Allocating not enough time to basic features of the system such as adding tables/input forms which are simple in design, but can still take time to implement.

- Not enough time allocated for testing, meaning eventual program is buggy and unusable.

- Not planning ahead & trying to incorporate too many advanced deliverables in too limited time.

**Prioritisation**

- Putting focus on advanced deliverables before basic functionality of system is finished–basic deliverables should be done first so that if anything is unfinished it will be the advanced tasks, which are less important than basic functionality.

- Lack of focus on mobile version of site vs. desktop version – both are equally important, should be worked on simultaneously.

## Assumptions

**Skills:**

- It is assumed that team members allocated to implementation are familiar/will be familiar with web languages such as PHP, HTML, CSS, and Javascript/Node.js

- It is assumed all team members are familiar with basic database design , as well implementation of databases using SQL.

**Availability:**

- It is assumed that all team members will be available to work on the project during the project timeframe, excluding holiday time.

- It is assumed that the client will be available to give feedback at all points in the project timeframe.

**Performance:**

- It is assumed that each team member will have completed all the work allocated to them before each deadline/project checkpoint.

- It is assumed the client will give accurate and detailed feedback to any parts of the system they are asked to comment on.

## Dependencies

1. The project requirements need to be fully completed and checked before any design work or implementation is started.

2. The requirements cannot be finalised until feedback and checking has been done by the client (In case any of the requirements are incorrect).

3. The implementation cannot be completed until all design work has been completed. (Some basic implementation could start while extra design features are being added)

4. Testing cannot be completed until all implementation/extra features have been added to the system.

## System Constraints

- Only 3 hours a week have been allocated for group meetings, which must be shared with other projects such as the CEP and LSEPI presentation. This limits the amount of time that can be spend on collaborative design & evaluation.

- Accounts have to be limited to only personal accounts due to, meaning anonymous or ‘guest’ accounts cannot be implemented.

- Contact between team members as well as direct collaboration will be limited over both the winter and spring holiday periods due to separation as well as varying availability.

## Additional Open Issues

- What are exact attributes associated with each food item?

- Does the system necessarily have to be a mobile app? (A web version of site would be preferable)

- For registration of users, does this feature have to be built into the system, or can it be outsourced via facebook/twitter?

- In general, how important is it that the site’s features are custom-designed vs. being outsourced?

- Does the site need Terms/Conditions & Licensing, for legal issues such as if someone receives out of date food/gets food poisoning?
