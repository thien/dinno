##Background

There are charities which supply a food sharing experience in events, by catering for events using only spare food. These act usually as a small group of committed individuals who collect the food, prepare it and then give it out whilst collecting some donations. This method means that there is a quality control at the charity collection level, meaning that the users of the prepared food have a greater confidence in the food. Not having this and having a more peer to peer approach to food sharing will get rid of this confidence - this is a problem to tackle.

An example of this method of food sharing is “REfUSE” a pop up cafe in Durham. They run on a “pay as you feel” basis in order for the cafe to keep running. Another way is to have a “community fridge” where a village has a shop-like place which is stocked and taken from by villagers for free.

In both respects, and any other future respects, there is a system which assists those with excess food and a willingness to support charity to those in need of food. It is key to link these two groups in an effective way.
In regards to security in these systems, there is little. Common personal details are needed to be protected of any people involved, but no more than usual - still it is a high priority. Other information in the system is on the food which has to be open for it to work successfully.

##Existing Applications

There is a current system in the form of an app called “OLIO - Food Sharing Revolution”. The app seems to have, overall, positive reviews. The one big downside to it is that food is not the only thing to be advertised on the app instead it is swamped with other non-edible items. This should be solved by having approved items only on the marketplace for users, either by a selected admin or by some automated method.

Easy to set up an account either through Facebook or email. It is easy to locate the food and see who has posted it, also it shows how long it has been posted for and allows for a short description.

We have found it to be quite busy looking with a long list of items sorted by distance to the user. There are no other options for ordering the list or searching - only a “Just Gone” section of the most recently posted food in an almost pointless nation level radius. The big downside is that it has to be popular to work, no one wants to travel very far to get an apple.
